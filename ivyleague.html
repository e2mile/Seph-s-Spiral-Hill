	<h1>What Happened</h1>
	<p>Seph is from a post apocalyptic world where nature has reclaimed the world. it wasn't the way that everyone was expecting, but one thing that most can agree on: it was the most beautiful. Something different about this world is that in a way that no one really questions, electronics can still work. You just have to remember that they're there. Although, they never seem to work the same way</p>
