	<h1>Sonic Boom</h1>
	<p>Seph can change their eye color any which way they please and they can float. Seph also has the ability to turn their voice into a sonic boom of varying degrees. Sometimes they'll use it if the ghosts ever get a tad bit too rowdy (which is rarely) or if there's a threat. Sometimes when trying to go places, there would be an obstacle too heavy to move and far too big to simple float past, so they would use a bit of their power</p>
