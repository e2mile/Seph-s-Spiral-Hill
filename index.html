	<p>Seph is a creature that aspires to resemble Jack Skeleton , if Jack still had skin... it's the double toned color palette that they like mostly; any two toned color palette really. They will make sure that they match whatever colors they chose that day, from their hair, -to the point of even changing their eyes- to their toes (except for their fingernails, they keep those clean). They also have two toned freckles across their cheeks and have sharp incisors in both rows of their teeth but they are more prominent on the bottom row.</p>
